# System Center Service Manager (SCSM) Tuning
This Tuning Pack covers the Microsoft System Center Service Manager (aka SCSM) management pack (captured with version 7.7.16.0 of both the Discovery MP and Monitoring MP).

## Levels
The below levels are included in this Tuning Pack. There are not (currently) any custom levels in this tuning pack.

### DiscoveryOnly
Disables all rules and monitors, only discoveries are left enabled. Great when onboarding new monitoring as turning off everything but discoveries lets you phase 

### MPDefault
Contains the SCSM MP authors default tuning. Good for setting a group/object to the tuning the MP author had intended for the MP.
