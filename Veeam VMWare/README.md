# Veeam VMWare Tuning
This Tuning Pack covers the Veeam VMWare management packs (captured with version 8.0.0.2451 of the MP).

## Levels
The below levels are included in this Tuning Pack. There are not (currently) any custom levels in this tuning pack

### DiscoveryOnly
Disables all rules and monitors, only discoveries are left enabled. Great when onboarding new monitoring as turning off everything but discoveries lets you phase 

### MPDefault
Contains the Unix/Linux authors default tuning. Good for setting a group/object to the tuning the MP author had intended for the MP.
