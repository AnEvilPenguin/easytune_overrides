# Tomcat Web (5, 6, 7, and 8) Tuning

Tomcat is a pure Java web server environment developed and maintained by an open community of developers under the Apache Software Foundation.  
Microsoft have authored all of the management packs affected by this tuning pack.

## Tuning Levels

The following tuning levels are included in this Tuning Pack.  
There are not (currently) any custom levels in this tuning pack.  

### Discovery Only

Disables all rules and monitors, only discoveries are left enabled. Great when onboarding new monitoring as turning off everything but discoveries lets you phase in new tuning.  

### MP Default

Contains the MP authors default tuning. Good for setting a group/object to the tuning the MP author had intended for the MP.
