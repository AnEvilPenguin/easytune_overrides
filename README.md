# Cookdown Easy Tune
If you've ever spent days explaining to teams what's monitored on their servers and hours implementing overrides only to be told that SCOM is still too noisy, you'll know why we created Easy Tune.

SCOM is known for management packs that provide in-depth monitoring for Microsoft and other enterprise technologies, but often the management packs offer *too* much detail. To be successful with SCOM, you have to tune SCOM.

Get started with these simple steps:

1.  Download the Easy Tune MP, which introduces a new tuning UI in the SCOM console
2.  For each of your monitored technologies (such as SQL Server 2016) choose the desired level of monitoring: discovery only, essential, balanced or full. You can set a global monitoring level, and levels for different groups if needed
3.  Click to apply the monitoring level
4.  Easy Tune does the rest! No need to manually create management packs or overrides

Easy Tune is provided as a free download. We believe every SCOM deployment should be tuned this way.
